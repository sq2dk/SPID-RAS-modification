Addition of absolute encoders for SPID RAS antenna rotator

Well known and wildly used SPID ( http://spid.net.pl/en/ ) RAS azimuth-elevation antenna rotators have incrimental encoder build into them. This means, that actual position of rotator can be lost by controller. Aditionally in basic configuration, we are getting rotator capable of only one degree of resolution (which is more than enough for most of the cases)
This project adds absolute encoders for azimuth and elecation to said rotator. As a encoded for azimuth magnetic encoder AS5600 is used, for elevation acceloreter will be used.
Project require some mechanical skills, as partial dissassembly of device is requided, access to tools such as spanners and hammer, one part has to be turned in the lathe or 3D printed. Reasonable degree of precision is required. Additionally some solidering and basic electronic skills are required as well.
